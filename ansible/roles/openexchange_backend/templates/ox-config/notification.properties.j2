# Direct links for notifications are generated according to the following pattern.
# [hostname] needs to be replaced with the hostname of your machine. This is done automatically by software on backend machines using the
# hosts canonical host name.
# [uiwebpath] is replaced with the value of com.openexchange.UIWebPath defined in server.properties.
# [module], [object] and [folder] are replaced with the relevant IDs to generate the direct link.

# TODO : use custom hostname for each domain (with CascadeConfig ?)
object_link=https://[hostname]/#m=[module]&i=[object]&f=[folder]

# This property defines which email address of a user is used as from header when this user triggers notification mails.
# Possible values are: primaryMail or defaultSenderAddress
com.openexchange.notification.fromSource=defaultSenderAddress
